# Beginner's Tutorials

If you are interested in learning how to program Arduino and create electronic circuits,you've come to the right place. This section covers the very fundamentals of practical electronics prototyping, and will serve as a primer for those interested in designing electronic hardware for robots and other embedded systems. 

The lessons are adapted from the QSTP Mechatronics course, taken by Abhishek Dixit and Tanmay Bhonsale. You don't need any hardware to get started, as all concepts and examples included here can be simulated on [TinkerCAD](http://tinkercad.com). Note that the lessons involve active participation; you will need to try out each example to fully grasp the material.
